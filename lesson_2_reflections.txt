What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it creates a .git folder in order to start storing meta-data about the files in the supposedly a new git repository. it doesn't however create the first commit for you.

You may also wish to run git status after you have created the file. You should see that now both files are listed as untracked files.

On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	lesson_1_reflections.txt
	lesson_2_reflections.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is more of a place to store the files that are being tracked for changes, it caches the file somewhere so when commit is executed it stores the differences in the git repo metadata to be tracked by git diff?
