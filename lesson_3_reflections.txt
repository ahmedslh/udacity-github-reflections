When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

To collaborate with others, have an online backup, share with others (interview,..etc.).

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks are for repo to repo over github, it's basically a clone but within github
branches are used when you are testing new feature or modification for example without impacting the master branch
clones are used when you copy repo from github to local directory or when you want to clone a repo locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

This would be specially important when collaborating with others, i would say with growing differences, it may be hard to take a decision about the differences.
