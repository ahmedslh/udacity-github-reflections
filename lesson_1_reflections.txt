How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It looks not very helpful, i used to use it to make sure that files were not changed from original version

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You learn from mistakes, and not invent the wheel

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

It will minimize the number of version controls, version controls will have more meaning

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because it's a feature of code, we write functions that are related, so saving them independently would be annoying to track changes across files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log will give you the log of commits used in this repository
git log --stat will also give you the log, plus some visuals about the additions and subtractions in each commit
git diff commit_id1 commit_id2 will display the file content highlighting the additions and deletions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Since it's easy to checkout an old version, it makes you more confident about changing stuff as you'll be able to conveniently roll back again
